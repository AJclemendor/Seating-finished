# Seating-finished


NON ML - Augmented seating software

Created for a school project and made in 1-2 days

Uses Greedy Search DFS to get data from a csv (Auto Generated from a google form)

"Student" objects are made and each student is given a unhappiness score based on
factors like distance on the board as it relates to eye sight, distance to friends, ect

A final board is returned and a visual repersentation of the board is exported to the original directory with the csv

This inspired PySeating_MLAUG (My ML augmented seating chart gen)
